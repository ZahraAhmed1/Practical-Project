SERVICE 1 (server): This will be communicating with the other servers and persisting data from the database based on the ERD diagram.

SERVICE 2 + 3 (animal_api and country_api): Both these servers randomly produce a animal and country from a list.

SERVICE 4 (winner_api): This server produces an outcome of 'lose' or 'win'. The outcome is based on service 2 and 3 and is determined by the length the animals type.
